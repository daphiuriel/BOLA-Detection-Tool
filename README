The BOLA Detection Tool is a Go-based utility designed to analyze access log files and detect potential BOLA
(Broken Object Level Authorization) attacks. It checks for unauthorized access patterns where a user tries to
access another user's resources without proper authorization.

The tool reads the provided access log file and scans the logs for any request where the user_id in the URL
or request body does not match the authenticated userâ€™s credentials.
If a user tries to access another user's data, the tool flags it as a potential BOLA attack.
For now, the tool only checks for BOLA attacks based on the user_id parameter in the logs.
